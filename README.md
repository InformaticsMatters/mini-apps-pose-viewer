# React components for scientific applications

This repository is a collection of re-usable React components that can be used to rapidly create what we term **mini-apps**, simple applications that are designed with a specific purpose in mind. The initial domain of interest is primarily computational chemistry and cheminformatics.

The initial components are in the early design phase and will appear here soon.

We anticipate these catergories of component:

* Charting using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/)
* 3D molecular viewer using [NGL Viewer](http://nglviewer.org/)
* Chemical sketcher using [JSME](https://peter-ertl.com/jsme/) (and maybe other sketchers)
* Molecule card view
* Molecular spreadsheet

Some of these components are inspired and partly derived from the [Fragalysis](https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/) and [Fragnet Search](https://fragnet.informaticsmatters.com/) applications, and most likely will be re-incorporated into those applications as components.

This repo will contain:
1. souce code for each component
2. documentation and examples for using each component
3. examples of how to combine components
